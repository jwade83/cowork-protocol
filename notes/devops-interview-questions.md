## 1. What's the Difference Between Docker and Kubernetes?

**What this question is testing:** Your understanding of containerisation and
container orchestration.

- Docker is a platform used to create, package, and run containers.
- Containers provide a lightweight and consistent environment for applications.
- Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that manages large numbers
  of containers.
- Kubernetes handles scaling, load balancing, self-healing, and deployment
  automation.
- In simple terms: Docker runs containers, Kubernetes manages containers at
  scale.

## 2. What Happens When You Type a Website URL Into Your Browser?

**What this question is testing:** Your knowledge of networking, DNS, and web
communication.

- The browser first checks DNS to find the website's IP address.
- A connection is established with the web server using TCP/IP and often HTTPS.
- The browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
- The server responds with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources.
- The browser processes these files and renders the webpage for the user.

## 3. What Is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

**What this question is testing:** Your understanding of modern infrastructure
management and automation.

- Infrastructure is defined using code rather than manual configuration.
- Changes can be version controlled, reviewed, and audited.
- IaC enables consistent and repeatable deployments.
- Common tools include Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible.
- It reduces human error and improves scalability and reliability.

## 4. What's the Difference Between a Load Balancer and a Reverse Proxy?

**What this question is testing:** Understanding of traffic management and
application architecture.

- A Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple servers.
- It improves availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.
- A Reverse Proxy sits between clients and backend services.
- It can provide caching, SSL termination, security, and routing.
- Some tools (e.g., NGINX) can perform both roles.

## 5. What Is CI/CD and Why Is It Important?

**What this question is testing:** Knowledge of modern software delivery
practices.

- CI (Continuous Integration) automates code building and testing.
- CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) automates application releases.
- It helps detect issues early in the development process.
- Reduces manual effort and deployment risks.
- Enables faster, more reliable software delivery.
